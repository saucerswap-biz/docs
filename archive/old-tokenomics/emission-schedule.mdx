The remaining 80.0% (800,000,000) of SAUCE tokens will be released over a period of 3 years. SAUCE in circulation (as a function of time) will follow a fixed supply, linear decay model, where the emission rate is constant. All tokens (excluding the 20.0% initially released) are distributed according to this emission schedule, meaning funds for the team, advisors, and marketing are locked in vesting contracts and distributed at the same pace as the  **farm rewards and DAO treasury emissions.

With Hedera (and within a native smart contract), there is no concept of a block, however, Hedera translates `block.timestamp` to be the consensus timestamp of the transaction. Emissions will therefore be calculated based on SAUCE *per minute*, rather than SAUCE *per block*. Approximately 507.36 SAUCE are brought into circulation every minute.

The emission rate for each allocation category is as follows:

Allocation Category

Emissions (% of Max Supply)

SAUCE / Min

Team

24.0%

152.21

Advisor

2.0%

12.68

Marketing

2.0%

12.68

DAO Treasury

2.0%

12.68

LP Farm Rewards

50.0%

317.10

**Total**

**80.0%**

**507.36**

The release schedule is visually represented in the Figure below:

The justification for emitting SAUCE via a linear decay emission model (emission rate is constant) over a non-linear model (emission rate decreases over time) is that farms will sustain APRs while core contributors implement additional mechanisms serving the role of, not only improving user experience, but also compensating for farm rewards once emissions run out.
