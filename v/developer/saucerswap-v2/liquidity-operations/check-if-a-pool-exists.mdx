title: "Check if a Pool Exists"
---

Check if a V2 liquidity pool for two sets of HTS tokens with a specific swap fee tier exists on-chain.

Checking if the liquidity pool with the matching fee tier exists using SaucerSwap's REST API is also a suitable alternative. For more information, see [Get all Liquidity Pools (V2)](/developer/saucerswap-v2/liquidity-operations/fetch-all-pools).

Function name: **getPool**

â›½ *No gas cost*

Parameter Name

Description

**address token0**

The contract address of either token0 or token1

**address token1**

The contract address of the other token

**uint24 fee**

The fee collected upon every swap in the pool, denominated in hundredths of a bip

  //IUniswapV3Factory.sol

  /// @notice Returns the pool address for a given pair of tokens and a fee, or address 0 if it does not exist
  /// @dev tokenA and tokenB may be passed in either token0/token1 or token1/token0 order
  /// @param tokenA The contract address of either token0 or token1
  /// @param tokenB The contract address of the other token
  /// @param fee The fee collected upon every swap in the pool, denominated in hundredths of a bip
  /// @return pool The pool address

  ) external view returns (address pool);
  ```
</Accordion>

When working with HBAR, use the WHBAR (Wrapped HBAR) token address for either tokenA or tokenB.

The ordering of tokens for token0 and token1 does not matter.

If the pool does not exist, a zero address will be returned.
