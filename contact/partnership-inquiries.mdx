For general partnership inquiries, you can contact us via email: [outreach@saucerswap.finance](mailto:outreach@saucerswap.finance), or by completing a [request form](https://z30ev00547x.typeform.com/to/YBGqwGup).

## Adding a Token[](#adding-a-token)

Anybody can 'list' a Hedera (HTS) token on SaucerSwap. You don't need to submit a request or ask permission; just create a liquidity pool, that's it. For V1 pool creation, see [Liquidity Pool Tutorials](https://docs.saucerswap.finance/get-started/saucerswap-tutorials/liquidity/saucerswap-v1).

Once there is at least 1 liquidity pool, users can then trade your token by entering the token ID (e.g. 0.0.12345)

## How to Add Token Icon/Logo[](#how-to-add-token-icon-logo)

Token information displayed on [saucerswap.finance](https://saucerswap.finance) is referenced from 2 sources:

* An IPFS or Arweave metadata link in the token's memo or metadata field, conforming to the [Hedera fungible token Metadata schema](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-405#schema).

  * Note: updating metadata requires a token having an admin or metadata key

* Token icon and information added to [Davinci Pics](https://davincigraph.io/#pics_home)

  * Note: adding or updating Davinci Pics data requires connecting the token's treasury account ID (or the account ID which executed the token create transaction) to Davinci to authenticate.

### Extended Listing Instructions

1. Create a liquidity pool containing your token + HBAR or another HTS token (e.g., SAUCE, USDC). There are no liquidity requirements for tokens on the extended list.

2. Submit a[ request form](https://z30ev00547x.typeform.com/to/YBGqwGup).

3. SaucerSwap Labs will add your token to the extended list within 4-5 business days of receiving the application.

### Default Listing Instructions

1. Complete a[ Sentinel report](https://sentinel.headstarter.org/) through HeadStarter. This involves answering basic questions about your project.

2. Once the report is published and you and your community have added $100,000 of liquidity for your token, plus an equivalent value of paired token(s), submit a [governance RFC](https://gov.saucerswap.finance/) to begin the listing process.

3. Following the RFC, submit a [governance proposal](https://www.saucerswap.finance/governance). The [SaucerSwap DAO](/governance/overview) will vote on your proposal. If it passes, an election will be triggered automatically and will be voted on for final approval from the DAO.

4. If the election passes, SaucerSwap Labs will promptly add your token to the default list.

## Yield Farm (V1)

Projects are eligible for a [yield farm](/protocol/saucerswap-v1#yield-farm) once their token has been added to either the default or extended list on the SaucerSwap interface. They may apply by submitting an [RFC](https://gov.saucerswap.finance/) and following the [governance process](https://docs.saucerswap.finance/governance/overview#governance-process). All approved yield farms will feature dual token emissions in the form of SAUCE and HBAR.

## LARI (V2)

The [Liquidity-Aligned Reward Initiative](/protocol/saucerswap-v2#liquidity-aligned-reward-initiative-lari) (LARI) is integrated into SaucerSwap V2, offering liquidity providers a way to earn additional incentives without staking. Activated upon creation of a V2 position, LARI allocates rewards in accordance with the size and efficacy of the liquidity contributed. These rewards are automatically distributed via airdrop at the end of two-week epochs.

LARI supports the distribution of multiple HTS tokens across various liquidity pools, thereby allowing projects to tailor campaigns specific to their token. For initiating a LARI campaign, inquiries can be directed to [outreach@saucerswap.finance](mailto:outreach@saucerswap.finance).
