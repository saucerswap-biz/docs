The Services include, but are not necessarily limited to, (a) [https://saucerswap.finance](https://saucerswap.finance), a website-hosted user interface, including a front-end graphical user interface (‚ÄúGUI‚Äù) (the ‚ÄúInterface‚Äù), and (‚Äéb) other domain names linking to the Interface or offered by us. You must read this Agreement and our Privacy Policy (‚ÄúPrivacy Policy‚Äù) (located at: [https://docs.saucerswap.finance/legal/privacy-policy](https://docs.saucerswap.finance/legal/privacy-policy)), which is incorporated by reference, carefully, as they govern your use of the Services. By accessing or using any of the Services, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to access or use any of our Services and should not use our Services.

To access or use any of our Services, you must be able to form a legally binding contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g., 18 years old in the United States) and have the full right, power, and authority to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity for which you may access or use the Services. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind such entity.

You further represent that you are not (a) the subject of economic or trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties (including but not limited to the list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury) or (b) a citizen, resident, or organized in a jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the United States.

### 1. Our Services

#### 1.1 The Interface and Protocol

The Interface provides a web or mobile-based means of access to a decentralized exchange (‚ÄúDEX‚Äù) on one or more public blockchains, including but not limited to Hedera, that allows users to trade certain compatible digital assets via the SaucerSwap Protocol (the ‚ÄúProtocol‚Äù or ‚ÄúSaucerSwap‚Äù). You understand and acknowledge that the Protocol is not a Service and the protocol is governed in accordance with the documentation located at [https://docs.saucerswap.finance/governance](https://docs.saucerswap.finance/governance) (‚ÄúGovernance‚Äù).

Saucerswap Labs does not control or operate any version of the Protocol on any blockchain network and the Protocol is governed in accordance with Governance. By using the Interface, you understand that you are not buying or selling digital assets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. As a general matter, Saucerswap Labs is not a liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and liquidity providers are independent third parties.

To access the Protocol, you must use a non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service. We do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your wallet to the Interface, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference.

#### 1.2 Other Services

We may from time to time in the future offer additional products, and such additional products shall be considered a Service as used herein, regardless of whether such product is specifically defined in this Agreement.

#### 1.3 Third Party Services and Content

When you use any of our Services, you may also be using the products, services or content of one or more third parties. Your use of such third-party products, services or content may be subject to separate policies, terms of use and fees of these third parties, and you agree to abide by and be responsible for such policies, terms of use and fees, as applicable.

### 2. Modification

All modifications will be effective when they are posted, and your continued accessing or use of any of the Services will serve as confirmation of your acceptance of those modifications. If you do not agree with any modifications to this Agreement, you must immediately stop accessing and using all of our Services.

#### 2.2 Modifications of our Services

We reserve the following rights, which do not constitute obligations of ours: (a) with or without notice to you, to modify, substitute, eliminate or add to any of the Services; (b) to review, modify, filter, disable, delete and remove any and all content and information from any of the Services.

#### 4.3 Non-Custodial and No Fiduciary Duties

We accept no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and make no representations or warranties regarding how any of our Services will operate with any specific wallet.

You further expressly waive and release us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to your use of any of our Services. If you are a California resident, you waive the benefits and protections of California Civil Code ¬ß 1542, which provides: ‚Äú\[a] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.‚Äù

### 8. Governing Law, Dispute Resolution and Class Action Waivers

#### 8.1 Governing Law

You agree that the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, govern this Agreement and any Dispute between you and us. You further agree that each of our Services shall be deemed to be based solely in the State of Florida, and that although a Service may be available in other jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside the State of Florida. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences interstate commerce. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. You agree that the federal courts of the Middle District of Florida and the state courts of the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Florida are the exclusive forums for any appeals of an arbitration award or for court proceedings in the event that this Agreement's binding arbitration clause is found to be unenforceable.

#### 8.2 Dispute Resolution

We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes through informal, good faith negotiations. If a potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to [legal@saucerswap.finance](mailto:legal@saucerswap.finance) so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute resolution. If we aren't able to reach an informal resolution within sixty days of your email, then you and we both agree to resolve the potential dispute according to the process set forth below.

At our sole discretion, we may elect to submit any Dispute to non-binding mediation. If an election to mediate is made, then such mediation shall be held in Duval or Nassau County, Florida, unless the parties agree otherwise, and it shall be conducted by a mediator selected by us. We reserve the right to appear by video conference to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to any of our Services, this Agreement, or any other acts or omissions for which you may contend that we are liable, including, but not limited to, any claim or controversy as to arbitrability (‚ÄúDispute‚Äù), shall be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the ‚ÄúAAA‚Äù) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the ‚ÄúAAA Rules‚Äù) then in effect, except as modified by this Agreement. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written demand for arbitration to the AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules and per Section 9.5 of this Agreement. The arbitration shall be selected pursuant to the AAA Rules. The arbitration will be held in Duval or Nassau County, Florida, unless you and we both agree to hold it elsewhere. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate your claims with those of any other party. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If for any reason a claim by law or equity must proceed in court rather than in arbitration you agree to waive any right to a jury trial and any claim may be brought only in the federal courts of the Middle District of Florida or the state courts of the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Florida.

The parties will each pay their own attorney‚Äôs fees and arbitration costs, unless the arbitrator makes an affirmative finding that a party‚Äôs claim is frivolous, in which case the party asserting the frivolous claim will be required to pay the other party‚Äôs attorney‚Äôs fees and arbitration costs.

#### 8.3 Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver

You must bring any and all Disputes against us in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff in or member of any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding. This provision applies to class arbitration. You and we both agree to waive the right to demand a trial by jury.

### 9. Miscellaneous

#### 9.1 Entire Agreement

These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings (if any) relating to the subject matter of the terms.

#### 9.2 Assignment

You may not assign or transfer this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer this Agreement without our prior written consent shall be null and void. We may freely assign or transfer this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

#### 9.3 Not Registered with the SEC or Any Other Agency

We are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You understand and acknowledge that we do not broker trading orders on your behalf. We also do not facilitate the execution or settlement of your trades, which occur entirely on public distributed blockchains like Hedera. As a result, we do not (and cannot) guarantee market best pricing or best execution through our Services. Any references in a Service to ‚Äúbest price‚Äù does not constitute a representation or warranty about pricing available through such Service, on the Protocol, or elsewhere.

#### 9.4 Relationship of the Parties

Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or is intended to be deemed, nor shall it cause you and us to be treated as partners, joint ventures, or either you or us to be treated as the agent of the other.

#### 9.5 Notice

You agree and consent to receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents, notices and disclosures (collectively ‚ÄúCommunication(s)‚Äù) that we may provide to you in connection with your use of the Service. You agree that we may provide such Communications via the primary email address you supply to us in your profile, instant chat, and/or through other electronic communications including but not limited to text messages or mobile push notifications. It is your responsibility to provide us with a true, accurate, and complete contact information. If we send you a Communication, but you do not receive it because your contact information is incorrect, blocked by a service provider, out of date, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic Communications, we will have been deemed to have provided the Communication to you.

Any notice or communications required to be given to us under this Agreement will be given and received via (i) email at [legal@saucerswap.finance](mailto:legal@saucerswap.finance), read and delivery receipt requested and confirmed; or (ii) sent by an overnight service with tracking capabilities to the address below, upon receipt; or (iii) sent by certified mail, upon signed receipt.
