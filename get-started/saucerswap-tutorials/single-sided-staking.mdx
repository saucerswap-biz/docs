1. **Understand Metrics**

* Scroll down to the "Phase 1" section. Here you will find:

  * SAUCE/xSAUCE: The exchange rate between SAUCE in the [Infinity Pool](/protocol/single-sided-staking) and circulating xSAUCE. This rate updates once a day when rewards are sent to the Infinity Pool.

  * Claimable SAUCE: The SAUCE you can claim if you unstake all your xSAUCE. Calculated by multiplying your xSAUCE by the SAUCE/xSAUCE rate.

  * TVL: Total claimable SAUCE in the Infinity Pool, in USD.

  * [Approximate APR](/protocol/single-sided-staking#calculating-apr): A 5-day average APR based on the growing SAUCE/xSAUCE exchange rate.
