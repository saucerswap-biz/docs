<Info>
  SaucerSwap V1 supports tokens with fractional fees but not those with fixed fees. In fractional fee tokens, the fee is deducted from the transaction amount, such as during a swap. However, for fixed fee tokens, this fee is applied separately. A workaround for fixed fees in SaucerSwap V1 is to set a fractional fee at 0% and use a fallback. For detailed guidance on implementing custom fees in the Hedera Token Service (HTS), refer to the [Hedera Docs](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/hedera-api/token-service/customfees).
</Info>

3\. **Setting Ratio**

* Input the initial amounts of TokenA and TokenB. The ratio between these tokens sets the pool's initial price. Aim to approximate market prices to avoid immediate arbitrage.

4\. **Pool Fee**

* Be aware that creating a pool incurs a $50 fee in HBAR as a security measure.

5\. **Final Step**

* Confirm all details and click the "Approve & Supply" button to create the pool. You can now view the pool's information on its new subpage.

## How to Manage a Position: Written Guide

*As a liquidity provider, I want to* [*supply liquidity*](/get-started/saucerswap-tutorials/liquidity/saucerswap-v1#supply-liquidity)  *to a specific pool so that I can earn fees. Once my liquidity is supplied, I wish to*[*stake my LP tokens*](/get-started/saucerswap-tutorials/liquidity/saucerswap-v1#stake-liquidity)  *to accrue additional farming rewards. After waiting for a suitable amount of time to maximize my yield, I want to*[*harvest my farm rewards*](/get-started/saucerswap-tutorials/liquidity/saucerswap-v1#harvest-rewards)*. Finally, after a second waiting period to accumulate more fees, I aim to* [*unstake my LP tokens*](/get-started/saucerswap-tutorials/liquidity/saucerswap-v1#unstake-liquidity)  *and*[*withdraw my liquidity*](/get-started/saucerswap-tutorials/liquidity/saucerswap-v1#withdraw-liquidity) *from the pool.*
