* Choose the tokens you intend to pool by clicking on Token A "Select a Token", and Token B "Select a Token"; and selecting the tokens you wish to pool either by scrolling through the list, or entering the token ID or name in the search bar.

SaucerSwap V1 supports tokens with fractional fees but not those with fixed fees. In fractional fee tokens, the fee is deducted from the transaction amount, such as during a swap. However, for fixed fee tokens, this fee is applied separately. A workaround for fixed fees in SaucerSwap V1 is to set a fractional fee at 0% and use a fallback. For detailed guidance on implementing custom fees in the Hedera Token Service (HTS), refer to the [Hedera Docs](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/hedera-api/token-service/customfees).

1. **Setting Ratio**

* Input the initial amounts of TokenA and TokenB. The ratio between these tokens sets the pool's initial price. Aim to approximate market prices to avoid immediate arbitrage.

1. **Pool Fee**

* Be aware that creating a pool incurs a $50 fee in HBAR as a security measure.

1. **Final Step**

* Confirm all details and click the "Approve & Supply" button to create the pool. You can now view the pool's information on its new subpage.

## How to Manage a Position: Written Guide

*As a liquidity provider, I want to* [*supply liquidity*](/get-started/saucerswap-tutorials/liquidity/saucerswap-v1#supply-liquidity)  *to a specific pool so that I can earn fees. Once my liquidity is supplied, I wish to*[*stake my LP tokens*](/get-started/saucerswap-tutorials/liquidity/saucerswap-v1#stake-liquidity)  *to accrue additional farming rewards. After waiting for a suitable amount of time to maximize my yield, I want to*[*harvest my farm rewards*](/get-started/saucerswap-tutorials/liquidity/saucerswap-v1#harvest-rewards)*. Finally, after a second waiting period to accumulate more fees, I aim to* [*unstake my LP tokens*](/get-started/saucerswap-tutorials/liquidity/saucerswap-v1#unstake-liquidity)  *and*[*withdraw my liquidity*](/get-started/saucerswap-tutorials/liquidity/saucerswap-v1#withdraw-liquidity) *from the pool.*

1. **Prerequisites**

* Launch the web-app and connect your [wallet](/get-started/hedera-guide/create-hedera-wallet).

* Ensure you have sufficient [HBAR](/get-started/hedera-guide/get-hbar) for network fees and tokens for liquidity provision.

1. **Navigate Interface**

* Available pools are found on the "Liquidity" page

* Existing positions are accessible via either the "V1 Positions" tab of the "Portfolio" page or directly from the "Liquidity" page.

**Note:** In contrast to V2, where fees are manually claimed, fees in V1 directly accumulate in the pool, increasing the value of each LP token. To claim your share of earned fees, simply withdraw liquidity.
