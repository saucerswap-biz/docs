4\. **Set Price Range**

* Setting the price range is a crucial step in concentrated liquidity provision, as it determines the price points at which your liquidity is utilized for trading. Here are the different methods to set the price range:

**Volatility Strategy:** SaucerSwap offers pre-configured volatility strategies such as "Focused," "Balanced," and "Relaxed." Selecting one of these automatically sets your price range.

**Manual Input:** Use the `+` and `-` buttons to manually adjust the upper and lower price limits for the position. This gives you more control but requires a good understanding of the token pair’s price dynamics.

**Depth Chart Handles:** The interface offers a graphical depth chart where you can drag handles to set the desired price range. This method provides a visual aid, however it also requires an understanding of the token pair’s price dynamics.

<Info>
  **Limit Order Emulation:** Setting the range entirely to one side (left for lower prices, right for higher prices) effectively acts as a limit order, converting your liquidity from tokenA \<-> tokenB when the price reaches a certain point.
