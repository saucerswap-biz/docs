## How to Swap Tokens: Written Guide

1. **Prerequisites**

* Launch the web-app and connect your [wallet](/get-started/hedera-guide/create-hedera-wallet).

* Ensure you have sufficient [HBAR](/get-started/hedera-guide/get-hbar) for network fees and tokens to swap.

1. **Specify Swap Details**

* Click on "TokenA" to bring up the token menu.

* Choose from a list of [Default and Extended tokens](/contact/partnership-inquiries#token-listing).

* For Untracked tokens, manually enter the token ID (e.g., *0.0.123456*).

* A disclaimer must be acknowledged for Extended and Untracked tokens.

* Repeat the above step for "TokenB."

* Input the quantity of tokens you wish to swap.

**ExactInput:** Swap an exact amount of TokenA for an estimated amount of TokenB.

**ExactOutput:** Swap an estimated amount of TokenA for an exact amount of TokenB.

* Set your preferred slippage tolerance in the settings. E.g., a 0.1% tolerance will cause the swap to fail if slippage exceeds this value.

  * **Slippage Tolerance:** This represents the [slippage](/get-started/faq#what-is-slippage) you are willing to tolerate in a trade. The default setting is 0.5%, but can be adjusted based on factors such as liquidity. To modify, click the pencil icon next to 'Slippage' or use the gear icon in the navigation bar. A lower value provides price accuracy but may result in failed transactions. Conversely, a higher value boosts transaction success rate but could lead to price discrepancies.

* Review swap details.

  * **Min. Received:** The minimum amount of TokenB received on a swap. This appears for `ExactInput` swaps and varies, depending on the slippage tolerance.

  * **Max. Sold:** The maximum amount of TokenA sold on a swap. This appears for `ExactOutput` swaps and varies, depending on the slippage tolerance.

  * **Price Impact:** The percentage difference between the market price and the estimated swap price. Higher impact indicates a less favorable swap, often due to low liquidity. Lower impact is usually better and occurs in high-liquidity pools.

  * **Fee:** A swap incurs a fee ranging from 0.05% to 1.00%, depending on the liquidity pool. Of this fee, 5/6 is allocated to liquidity providers, while 1/6 goes to the protocol. Keep in mind that this is separate from Hedera network fees. Multi-hop swaps incur a fee for each involved liquidity pool.
