[Hashport](https://www.hashport.network/) is an enterprise-grade bridge that facilitates the movement of digital assets between Hedera and other networks, including Ethereum, Optimism, Cronos, BNB, Polygon, Fantom, Moonbeam, Base, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Aurora.

You can trade many tokens supported by Hashport on the SaucerSwap protocol, such as WBTC, WETH, USDC, and USDT. On Hedera, these tokens are denoted with an \[hts] subscript to indicate their bridged status. For example, USDC\[hts] is bridged from Ethereum, while USDC is native to Hedera.

To initiate asset transfers to Hedera via Hashport, you can go directly to the [Hashport Portal](https://app.hashport.network/). For those looking for a guided approach, step-by-step instructions are available at[ Hashport Getting Started](https://www.hashport.network/getting-started/).
