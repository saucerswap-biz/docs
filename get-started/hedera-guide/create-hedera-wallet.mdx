### RPC

When first connecting your MetaMask account to Hedera, you will need to add a JSON-RPC relay to enable communication between MetaMask and Hedera.

You have two options for this:

1. Use [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/chain/295) to effortlessly add the Hashio RPC, which is maintained by Swirlds Labs.

2. Manually input the required information for the JSON-RPC relay.

   * **Network Name:** Hedera Mainnet

   * **RPC URL:** [https://mainnet.hashio.io/api](https://mainnet.hashio.io/api)

   * **Chain ID:** 295

   * **Currency Symbol:** HBAR

   * **Block Explorer URL:** [https://hashscan.io/mainnet/dashboard](https://hashscan.io/mainnet/dashboard)

Either way, this step is crucial for interaction between MetaMask and Hedera.
