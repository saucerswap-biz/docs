title: "Get HBAR"
---

HBAR is the native token of the Hedera network. It is used to pay transaction fees, similar to ETH on the Ethereum network. HBAR can be obtained through various methods:

## Centralized Exchanges

HBAR is available on many exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, and MEXC. A full list of exchanges that support HBAR can be found here: [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hedera/#Markets).

## Fiat-to-Crypto Gateways

HBAR can be purchased using various payment methods such as credit/debit cards, bank transfers, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. These transactions can be conducted in your bank account's local currency through fiat-to-crypto gateways like [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/buy/hbar) or [Banxa](https://banxa.com/). You can access these services either directly on their websites or via the HashPack wallet.

## Discord Faucet

The [SaucerSwap Discord server](https://saucerswap.finance/discord) offers a faucet bot that dispenses small amounts of HBAR.

Here's how to get started:

1. Open Discord and navigate to the SaucerSwap server.
2. Follow the Wickbot prompts to verify your Discord account.
3. After verification, navigate to the faucet bot channel and enter `!sparechange <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>`. Use either your Hedera account ID (e.g., `0.0.123456`) or your EVM address from MetaMask (e.g., `0x1D66f32F...5d716DdC`).
4. Your account will be funded with a **one-time** allotment of \$0.275 worth of HBAR.

The main goal of the faucet is to provide you with a minimal amount of HBAR. You should use this HBAR to cover the network fees for swapping any tokens you may have - such as tokens bridged through [Hashport](/get-started/hedera-guide/bridge-to-hedera) - for more HBAR. The newly acquired HBAR can then be used to pay network fees on subsequent transactions.
